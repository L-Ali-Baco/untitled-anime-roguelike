- **Mobility:** Very Fast (1.6x Move Speed)
- **Attack Type:** Ranged (Rapid fire, auto-aim)

**Abilities**

- **Kinetic Scrubber (Passive):** As the Scrapper moves, they build up Heat. Once the Heat meter reaches 100%, their next shot will overload, dealing a 15-stud kinetic blast that applies a 20% Armor Shred debuff (enemies take 20% more damage) to all targets caught in the radius for 5 seconds. Consumes all heat and incurs a 2.5s cooldown before heat can build again.
- **Trip-Wire Spool (Skill 1):** The Scrapper anchors a spool and runs to draw a laser trip-wire across the battlefield. Pressing the skill again locks it in place. The first enemy to cross the wire detonates it in a massive 20-stud shrapnel explosion, taking heavy damage and knockback. (8s Cooldown)
- **Scavenger's Slide (Dash):** `Shift`
  Overrides the standard dash with a high-speed, 0.35s invulnerable slide. Sliding directly into or past an enemy triggers a 12-stud AOE physical knockback blast around the target, throwing enemies out of the Scrapper's path. (3s Cooldown)
